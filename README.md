<h1>prime.me</h1>
<h3>Python web aptilcation</h3>
price.me is a web app written in python that allows users to make an account and add products that they 
want to buy from the supported stores (Admin users can also add stores) at their desired price. Should the
price of the item drop to that level or less the app sends an email to the user's registered e-mail.
